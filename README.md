# UnlimitedDocWorks

**UnlimitedDocWorks** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to process both unstructured documents and structured CSV data. It enables intelligent querying across diverse data sources, using state-of-the-art language models and orchestration tools.

The system utilizes **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for natural language understanding and **LangChain** for integrating data retrieval, parsing, and response generation workflows.

## Features

- Query over documents and CSVs with source-aware responses
- Support for both unstructured (e.g., PDFs, text files) and structured (e.g., tabular CSV) data
- Backed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and LangChain for accurate, context-rich results
- Modular and extensible full-stack architecture
